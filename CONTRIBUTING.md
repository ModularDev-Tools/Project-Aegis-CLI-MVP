### Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes and new features. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

#### 1. Set Up Your Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Project-Aegis-CLI.git
    cd Project-Aegis-CLI
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** to keep dependencies isolated:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4. **Install the project in editable mode** with test dependencies. This command is also found in the `README.md`:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .[test]
    ```

    This will install the project so that your changes to the source code are immediately reflected when you run the `aegis` command.
